Blockchain Betting - Question 4 of the FinTech and Cryptocurrencies exam.

The 'Wager' smart contract
1. mints a token representing a bet made on a eSports match prior or during live-play
2. determines the payoffs following the conclusion of the match
3. makes a transaction sending the winnings to the bettor or burns the token if bet was lost

I first tried to implement the smart contract as an ERC721 non-fungible token, however ran into a number of issues. I then restarted the project but unfortunately could not complete the smart contract or tests. In hindsight the idea was too ambitious for my skill level and remaining time.
